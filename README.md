# Fantasy Tracker

This app is a work in progess designed to track advanced and historical metrics for The People's League. The greatest fantasy baseball league. Will be publicly deployed via Heroku soon.

#### Built with:
* Rails 5
* Nokogiri
* Elasticsearch
* React

#### Roadmap:
* lifetime head to head standings
* Highest daily score reached (per team, per position, per season)
* Highest weekly score reached (per team, per position, per season)
* Historical moments (such as Robinson Cano putting up 20 points on the last day of the season to sneak Jacob into the playoffs where he'd eventually win).
* Other sports besides baseball
